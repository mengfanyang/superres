# Super Resolution PyTorch Implimentation

This is a set of PyTorch implementation of latest research paper:
[Photo-Realistic Single Image Super-Resolution Using a Generative Adversarial Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04802) and [Real-Time Single Image and Video Super-Resolution Using an Efficient Sub-Pixel Convolutional Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05158).

Those are roughly verified the correctness on small dataset. Much intensive check for the reproducibility with large trainingset will be done sometime soon. Especially for SRGAN the outputs are look differently from the orginal paper so it has to be inspected more.
